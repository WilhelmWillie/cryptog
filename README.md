# CryptoG

CryptoG is a simple Python script that uses Twilio and Coinbase's API to send SMS alerts whenever the price of Bitcoin changes by a significant amount. 

## Installation and Usage
To install and use CryptoG, download the required libraries from `requirements.txt`, fill out `config.yml` with your desired configuration, then run `python cryptog.py`. 

In `config.yml`, you have the ability to define a few parameters such as the update period and change threshold. See `example_config.yml` for an example config file.

## To-Do
In the future, I plan to add support for LTC and ETH.
